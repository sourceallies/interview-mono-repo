Vending Machine Problem

1. Create vending machine
    print out welcome message

2. add item to inventory
    internal storage
    define item

    test: add to inventory, 
        test inventory count for item

3. Purchase a product
    input: money, product slot
    return "not enough money" if the input money isn't enough

    add money

TODO:
- Maybe add pylance
- refactor tests setup

### vending_machine.purchase_product(slot, money): (message: str, change: float)

1. if they have more enough money
  "here's a {name of the item}, enjoy!", some number
2. if they have exactly enough money
 "here's a {name of the item}, enjoy!", 0
3. if they dont have enough money
  "you need more money", 0


Vending items data:
Item : {
    Slot: row, number
    Type: what kind of item is it
    Price: how much does it cost
    Quantity: how many are in stock
}
